# v0.0.9    2022-06-28
#
#   - Don't internally use roles, as the aim is to eventually be able
#     to have Mite use Mite instead of Moo, and Mite doesn't provide roles.
#   - Fix minor pod formatting inconsistency.
#   - Rename the `extends` method in Mite::Class to `superclasses` to avoid
#     confusion with the exported `extends` function.
#   - Mite::Class shouldn't accidentally try to use Try::Tiny::XS to
#     implement strict constructors.
#   - Require Type::Tiny 1.014000.
